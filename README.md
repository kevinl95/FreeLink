# FreeLink

This Netlify template lets you create censorship-resistant redirects. Deploy your own redirect site in seconds.

## Why?

Certain platforms censor links to important services. This allows you to generate your own **censorship-resistant link** using a free Netlify account.

Why not just use a link shortener? Platforms can easily censor link shorteners, just like they can the link you're trying to post. FreeLink hopes to create a game of whack-a-mole with unique domains per user that are too hard to censor.

## Setup

1. Click **"Deploy to Netlify"** above.
2. Enter the **URL** you want to redirect to when prompted.
3. Set up a **custom domain** in Netlify settings.

By default, Netlify gives you a free subdomain like `your-site.netlify.app`, but you can connect your own domain for better branding and stability.

1. Go to your Netlify Dashboard ‚Üí Domain Settings.
2. Click "Add a Custom Domain" ‚Üí "Register a New Domain".
3. Follow the steps to purchase a domain and Netlify will handle the setup for you.

### Option 2: Use an Existing Domain

If you already own a domain (from Namecheap, Google Domains, etc.):

1. Go to your Netlify Dashboard ‚Üí Domain Settings.
2. Click "Add a Custom Domain" and enter your domain name.
3. Follow the instructions to update your domain‚Äôs DNS settings:
    - Set a CNAME record pointing `www.yourdomain.com` to `your-site.netlify.app`.
    - (Optional) Set an A record pointing `yourdomain.com` to Netlify‚Äôs IP (found in their docs).
4. Wait for the DNS changes to propagate (usually a few minutes to an hour).
